Python Project Folder Maker

The Python Project Folder Maker is a simple graphical user interface (GUI) application that automates the process of creating a new Python project folder with standard subfolders and files. It also creates a virtual environment if requested and an auxiliary file to install the required libraries.

Features:

- Creates a project folder with subfolders for src, data, tests, and docs.
- Creates Python scripts for main and utility functions in the src folder.
- Creates README and design documentation in the docs folder.
- Creates an auxiliary file to install required libraries.
- Option to create a virtual environment with the desired name.
- Increment project feature to automatically increase the version number of a project.

Requirements:

- Python 3.6 or later
- Tkinter module (included in standard Python distribution)

How to use:

- Download the script and save it to your desired directory.
- Open the script in a Python IDE or text editor.
- Run the script.
- Enter the project name, select the project directory, and optionally enter a virtual environment name and custom folder name.
- Click the "Create Project or Initialize Increment" button to create the project.
- A success message will be displayed upon completion.

Note:

- The script generates a virtual environment using Python's built-in venv module. Ensure that your Python installation includes the venv module.
- The script automatically creates a "main.py" file in the "src" folder. This file is intended as the starting point for your project and can be modified as required.
- The "auxiliarylibs_install.py" file generated by the script can be used to install the required libraries for your project. Simply add the library name and version number to the "REQUIRED_LIBRARIES" list.
- The "design.md" file in the "docs" folder can be used to document the design of your project.
